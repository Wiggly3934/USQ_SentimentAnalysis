<b>Sentiment Analysis in Depressed Populations</b>

This suite of scripts were designed (and since adapted) for my research into mental health disorders, with the hope it might be re-used and/or see continued development by other parties.

If you find a use for this code and/or improve upon it, any shoutouts or citations would be appreciated. 

I am always open to connections via Linked-in.
