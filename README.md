<b>Sentiment Analysis in Depressed Populations</b>

This suite of scripts were designed for my research into mental health disorders and have been adapted since their use, with the hope it might be re-used and developed on by other parties.

If you find a use for this code and/or improve upon it, any shoutouts and or citations would be greatly appreciated. 

I am always open to connections via Linked-in.
